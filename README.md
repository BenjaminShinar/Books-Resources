[WebSockets in 100 Seconds & Beyond with Socket.io](https://youtu.be/1BfCnjr_Vjg)

good for realtime data. high speed, low latency._event based_ (callbacks).
we start with an tcp/ip connection, and then move to the websocket protocol (_ws_).

Socket.io is library that extends the abilities of the websocket and provides common solutions like broadcasting (messaging all other clients on this url)

_**cors** : cross origin resource sharing_

there're also **webRTC** for video/voice, and **webTransport** as a possible upgrade for the webSocket protocol.
