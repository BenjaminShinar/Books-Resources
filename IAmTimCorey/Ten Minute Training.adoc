=== Constant Interpolation in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less
.String interpolation in constant time situations
[%collapsible]
====
new constant evaluation of strings in C# 6.0, we can use string interpolation. better to `const` then `readonly`.

[source, csharp]
----
const string companyName = "Acme"; // no problem
const string productName = $"{companyName} Anvils";  // new for C# 10
const string productDescription = $"{productName} are the best way to crush your enemies";
----

one place where we can use this is for attributes,allowing them to have custom text.
[source, csharp]
----
[Obsolete($"This is no longer used for {companyName}")]
void SayHi()
{

}
----
====

=== Date and Time in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less
.Simplified Objects for Data and Time
[%collapsible]
====
until C# 10, we had a combined object for Date and Time. now we can have separate objects, which we can work on in different ways. such as taking the month and the day of the week for date only objects, and it will also not have weird rollOver behavior depending on timezones. it's not a full dateTime object. +
the timeOnly object is also just for time, without caring about timezones and other stuff.


[source, CSharp]
----
var  dateTime = DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine(dateTime);
DateOnly dateOnly = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);
TimeOnly timeOnly = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);
----

====

=== Deconstructor Updates in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less
.Mix and Match tuple unpacking
[%collapsible]
====

we start with tuple, we can do tuple de-construction and unpack it, we can also declare the variable ahead of time and unpack it, but until C#10, we couldn't combine them.
[source, CSharp]
----
var person = (FirstName: "Time", LastName: "Corey");
(string fName, string lName) = person; // inline declaration worked in c#9

string fn;
string ln;

(fn,ln) = person; // declared ahead of time
(fn, string lastName) = person; // mix and match styles

----

====

=== File Scoped Namespaces in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less

.A Different way of marking the namespace
[%collapsible]
====

file scoped namespace, in the past, we had all of our code inside a namespace, in a block scope manner, so everything was indented inside the file.

[source, csharp]
----
namespace OldWay
{
  public class oldClass
  {

  }
}
----

the new way allows us to declare namespaces just for the file, which allows us to start writing code from the left most side of the file.

NOTE: we can only have one namespace per file this way, which is how it should be anyway

[source, csharp]
----
namespace newWay;
public class newWay
{

}
----
====

=== Global Usings in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less

.Removing Boilerplate import statements
[%collapsible]
====

we can move all the `using` statements into a single file, and then it's implicitly used everywhere.

when we mark a using statement with `global using`, then it will available for all other files in the project. the bast way to do this is to combine the global statements into a single file.

this can also work with `global using static` to drop some boiler plate code.

CAUTION: there is a reason that we have namespace, we should make sure to avoid namespace pollution and confusion,
====

=== Null Parameter Checks in C# 10 and .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less

.Easy Null Check and throwing exceptions
[%collapsible]
====


if we want to protect against null values, we usually use check manually for null and throw `ArgumentNullException`. but now we can do it directly.
[source, csharp]
----
string? info = null;
void SayHi(string message)
{
  ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(message); 
  Console.WriteLine($"Hello {message}");
}
----
====

=== Hot Reload in .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less

.Hot reload works anywhere
[%collapsible]
====
hot reloading means the application is updated as code changes but without restarting it. there is a "fire" icon in visual studio. the state of the program remains.

it should work on Blazor and also older c# projects, like WPF.

this makes the development loop much faster.

since this works with 'dot.net watch' (the command line version), then hot reload will also work with visual studio code.
====

=== Intro to Tuples in C# In 10 Minutes or Less

.Using Tuples as a return type
[%collapsible]
====

returning more than one value, we could use out parameters (like `out ref`) or create a specific class for it. but it's easier to return a tuple.

we can name the resulting parameters and the refer to it as the named elements (rather than item1 and item2) or unpack it directly. we can also use the discard character - the underscore `_` if we don't care about one of the values.

[source, csharp]
----

(string address, bool isValid) ValidateAddress(string address)
{
  return ("as", false);
}
----
====

=== Parameter and Variable Tooltips in Visual Studio In 10 Minutes or Less

.Visual Studio Editor Hints
[%collapsible]
====

in the settings menu, we can turn on "inline variable hints", which would display the names of the positional parameters. we can also display inline type hints when we use the `var` keyword. this is very good for LINQ expressions

[source, csharp]
----
(string message, int length) SayHello(string firstName, string lastName)
{
  string output = $"Hello {firstName} {lastName}";
  return (output, output.Length);
}
----
====

=== Implicit Usings in .NET 6 In 10 Minutes or Less
.Auto Generated `Using`s
[%collapsible]
====

we no longer need to write directly `using System;` to use the console. the most common import statements are auto generated into the "global usings" file.  it will have the `global using global::System;` statement and it will be directly available from all files. we can turn this feature off by modifying the the project file and disabling it. we can also add and remove them with "ItemGroup" attributes and even give them aliases in a global way.

[source, xml]
----
<ItemGroup>
  <Using Remove="System"/>
  <Using Include="System.Data"/>
  <Using Include="SomeProject.Data.SQL" Alias="SQLDA"/>
</ItemGroup>
----
====

=== Tweaking Kestrel

.Setting how launching web servers works
[%collapsible]
====
Kestrel and IIS are ways of creating local web servers. we can tweak the setting in the "launchSettings.json" file. we can change the profiles, the ports (http and https) and environment variables. 
====

=== Custom Naming Styles in Visual Studio 2022
.Customizing Naming styles and warning
[%collapsible%open]
====
We can change the Code style suggestion and auto generations of code. we can create new styles and assign severities for them.
====

=== The New MongoDB Analyzer In 10 Minutes or Less

.Analyzing MongoDB C# code
[%collapsible]
====
A roselyn analyzer, so we need to install the package from nuget "MongoDb.analyzer". This helps us analyze C# code queries and show us the raw query, and it tells us if the query is recognized by mongoDB or if it's broken somehow.

if we want to change the settings, we need a file "mongodb.analyzer.json" at the root folder.
====

=== Getting a MongoDB Atlas Connection String In 10 Minutes or Less

.Connecting to Mongo AtlasDB
[%collapsible]
====
we go to the AtlasDB web console and grab the connection string for an application and take the C# version. we can also grab a code sample from there.

we need to replace the "<password>" and database as the default database. in visualStudio we add the string to the launch settings or at the user secrets file.

====

=== Editorconfig In Visual Studio In 10 Minutes or Less

.Per Project Configurations
[%collapsible]
====
Some settings shouldn't be global, but set for each project. such as editor preferences, code styles, etc... rather than have all developers set their IDE in the same way, we can push the changes into a editorConfig file and have them as part of the source control.
====

=== Intro to Core WCF In 10 Minutes or Less

.WCF is now compatible with .Net Core
[%collapsible]
====

CoreWCF is a way to bring existing WCF code into .Net Core and move away from .Net framework. WCF is Windows Communication Foundation, and should have been replaced with gRPC. the CoreWCF comes with new templates 
====

=== Intro to Core WCF In 10 Minutes or Less

.Features Worth knowing
[%collapsible]
====
An api project type

* authentication
* docker
* controllers
* openAPI Support (swagger)
** xml code comments
** web console
* built-in dependency injection
* the "appsettings.json"
** normal
** development phase overrides
** user only secrets
* default logger service
* data validation of models
** `[Required]`
** `[MinLength]`

=== NET 7 Update: Simplified LINQ Ordering In 10 Minutes or Less

.Simplified Ordering in LINQ statements
[%collapsible]
====

when there is a default ordering for objects (IComparable) then we can use the default ordering in LINQ.

[source, csharp]
----
var ages = new List<int>() {51, 87, 23, 84};
var sortedOld = ages.OrderBy(x => x);
var sortedNew = ages.Order();
----
there is also `OrderDescending()`.
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Nullable Models in MVC in 10 Minutes or Less

.Views can accept nullable models.
[%collapsible]
====
nullable page and view models in Blazor apps. MVC is model-view-controller. +
we can now have nullable views and handle this case.

[source, cshtml]
----
@model List<string>?

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "ToDo";
}

<h1>ToDo</h1>

@if(Model is null)
{
  <p>You have no ToDo items</p>
}
else
{
  <ul>
  @foreach (var todo in Model)
  {
    <li>@todo</li>
  }
  </ul>
}
----
in the example code, we have a null list (not empty), so we can protect against null values

====

=== .NET 7 Update: Blank Templates for Blazor in 10 Minutes or Less

.Blank Templates For Blazor.
[%collapsible]
====

new templates for blazor Web Assembly in .Net 7, we can use an "full" template or an "empty" one, the full template had a starting application (weather forecast) with some example pages to work from, the empty template is cleaner and is trimmed down.

the full templates are great for starting and learning good practices, and the blank template is for more advanced users.
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Nanoseconds in DateTime in 10 Minutes or Less

.Access to MicroSeconds and NanoSeconds in Time Objects.
[%collapsible]
====

added direct access for micro and nano seconds properties of time objects such as DateTime, TimeStamp, DateTimeOffset and TimeOnly. + 
before .Net7 we had those values from calculating the ticks, the level of precision didn't increase, and we get nano seconds in precision of hundred nanoseconds (0,100,...,800,900). 

[source, csharp]
----
DateTime demo = DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine($"Ticks: {demo.Ticks}");
Console.WriteLine($"Micro Seconds: {demo.Microsecond}");
Console.WriteLine($"Nano Seconds: {demo.Nanosecond}");
----

====

=== .NET 7 Update: Creating Tar Files in C# in 10 Minutes or Less

.Support for Tar Archive Files Operations.
[%collapsible]
====

windows uses zip files, but unix machines use tar files for archive. wc can create and extract from the tar files.
[source, csharp]
----
using System.Formats.Tar;

TarFile.CreateFromDirectory(@"c:\temp\TarDemo\Source", @"c:\temp\TarDemo\Demo.tar", false); // string literal

TarFile.ExtractToDirectory(@"c:\temp\TarDemo\Demo.tar",@"c:\temp\TarDemo\Extracted", false); // not overwriting existing files
----
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Raw String Literals in 10 Minutes or Less

.Raw String Literals with Custom Starting Markers.
[%collapsible]
====
Raw string literals, csharp 11. verbatim strings have problem with indentations and how the date differs in the code and values. raw string literals use the three double quotes like python multi-line strings. if we want to use three consecutive quotes inside the text, we can simply decide to use four quotes as the start and end markers. if we wnt string interpolation, we can use the "$" sign, and if we have curly braces as part of the text, we can use "$$" in the starting string so only double curly braces will be interpolated.

[source, csharp]
----
string rawString;
rawString = @"C:\Test{hello}"; // verbatim 
rawString = @$"C:\Test{hello}"; // verbatim with string interpolation
rawString ="""
{
  "Json":{
    "Inner":"abc",
    "Other": 111,
    "Third":["a","b","c"]
  }
}
"""; // raw string literal

var level = "waring";
rawString =$$""""
{
  "Json":{
    "Inner":"""abc",
    "Level": "{{level}}",
    "Other": 111,
    "Third":["a","b","c"]
  }
}
""""; // raw string literal with interpolation
----

====

=== .NET 7 Update: Required Properties in 10 Minutes or Less

.Require New Objects to Initialize Property Members. 
[%collapsible]
====
ensuring properties have values, without requiring a constructor, otherwise we might get un intended null values. however, we need to mark our constructors and indicate the fullfil the requirements with `[SetsRequiredMembers]`.

old way
[source, csharp]
----
public class Person{
  public string FirstName {get; set;}
  public string LastName {get; set;}
  public Person(string first, string last)
  {
    FirstName = first;
    LastName = last
  }
  public Person()
  {
    FirstName = "first";
    LastName = "last"
  }
}
----

new way - marking properties as "required" so any creation must assign values to it
[source, csharp]
----
public class Person {
  public required string FirstName {get; set;}
  public required string LastName {get; set;}

  [SetsRequiredMembers]
  public Person(string first, string last)
  {
    FirstName = first;
    LastName = last
  }
}
----
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Blazor Loading Animation in 10 Minutes or Less

.Pre Configured Loading Animation in Blazor Apps.
[%collapsible]
====
Just for blazor web assembly, not for blazor web server.

There is circle graph that fills up in percentages to display loading progress in blazor apps.

we can modify the starting animation in the "index.html" file. this is exposed via a css variable.
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Blazor Virtualization Update in 10 Minutes or Less

.Virtualizing Table Elements in Blazor Apps
[%collapsible]
====
The suggestion site uses Blazor and has virtualization to render the suggestion list. objects are loaded and unloaded at runtime. in the "inspect"

but in some cases it can't do this virtualization simply. we can't add "div" elements to a table directly, so we add `<Virtualize>` and add "SpacerElement" to determine which type of element to virtualize.

[source, cshtml]
----
<tbody>
  <Virtualize Items="@forecasts" Context="forecast" OverScanCount="50" SpacerElement="tr">
    <tr>
      <td>@forecast.Data.ToShortDateString()</td>
      <td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td>
      <td>@forecast.TemperatureF</td>
      <td>@forecast.Summary</td>
    </tr>
  </Virtualize>
</tbody>
----
this makes the fetching faster and needs less memory.
====

=== .NET 7 Update: List Patterns in 10 Minutes or Less

.Pattern Matching on Lists And Arrays
[%collapsible]
====
[source, csharp]
----
csv = "some,text,data";
string[] info = csv.Split(',');

if (info is [var id, _, _)])
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Id is {id} and has exactly three values");
}
else {
  Console.WriteLine("bad input");
}
----
if we want to match zero or more matches, we can use `..` (two dots) to discard zero or more variables, and we can also capture afterwards, so we could take the first three and last three elements, and discard all the rest.

we can also validate directly on values.

[source, csharp]
----
csv = "1,sue,storm,dis,dis,final";
string[] info = csv.Split(',');

if (info is ["1" or "2", var firstName, var lastName), .., var last])
{
  Console.WriteLine($"Id is {id} and has exactly three values");
}
else {
  Console.WriteLine("bad input");
}
----
====

=== .NET 7 Update: Newlines in String Interpolation in 10 Minutes or Less

.We Can Break Our String Interpolation Code Into Different Lines.
[%collapsible]
====

[source, csharp]
----
int age = 44;
string ageText = age switch
{
  > 80 => "old",
  > 60 => "getting old"
  > 20 => "a good age"
  _    => "young"
};

Console.writeLine($"The user is {age} years old, which is {ageText}");
----
we can replace it with a single line and perform the switch case inside. now we can break through our string interpolation and make it more readable.

[source, csharp]
----
int age = 44;
Console.writeLine($"The user is {age} years old, which is {age switch
  {
    > 80 => "old",
    > 60 => "getting old"
    > 20 => "a good age"
    _    => "young"
  }
}".);
----
====

=== Running RabbitMQ Locally with Docker

.Running RabbitMQ Locally on a Docker Container
[%collapsible]
====
RabbitMQ is an open source message broker for publisher/subscriber pattern.

Using docker-desktop is the easiest way

[source, shell]
----
docker container run -d -h rmq --name rabbit-server -p 8080:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitMQ:3-management
----

* `-d, --detached` for detached, so it's not tied to the terminal which ran it.
* `-h, --hostname` the name of the hosting container.
* `--name` is the container name.
* `-p, --port` maps port from the hosting machine to the container.

we can navigate to rabbitMQ server in our browser with the default user name and password (both "guest").
