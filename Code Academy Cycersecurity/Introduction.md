# Introduction to Cybersecurity

document detailing what I learned from the [code academy class about cyber secuirty](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity).



## Lesson 1 - What is Cyber Security

### Intro

Cybersecurity is the field of study and practice that responds to these challenges as technology evolves. In a formal definition by CISCO:
> “Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.”

the CIA triad -  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

#### Confidentiality

keeping private data private from those who should see it.
* permissions, levels of access
* encrypting adata and files
* Requiring multi-factor authentication. 

#### Integrity

protecting data from changes or deletion, providing ways to restore data if it was corrupted.
* keeping backups of data, mainting and logging previous versions.
* securly check for changes using cryptography
* Keeping track of digital signatures to prove integrity of data

#### Availability

data shoudl be availble where and when we need it, even when the network traffic is high or an external disaster occured.
* consistent monitoring of servers and networks
* maintaing hardware and software
* disaster recovery
  

### The Industry

everycompany uses computers and the internets, so every company needs cybersecurity. there are differnet domains.

* Security Engineering
* Governance and Compliance
* Risk Management & Threat Intelligence
* Security Operations
* Education

### A silly quiz

> **Risk management** refers to identifying risks, assessing the pros and cons of certain security vulnerabilities, and finding the most cost-effective and efficient security solutions. **Threat intelligence** is the continuous gathering of knowledge of possible attacks.

> **Security compliance** is about making sure an organization enforces certain regulations and policies and continuously audits.
