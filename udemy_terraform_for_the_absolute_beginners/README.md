## Infrastructure as Code

Iac - Infrastructure as Code

### Challenges with Traditional IT Infrastructure

in the traditional model of deploying applications, we have a solution architect that specifies which hardware is needed, and it all needs to belong to the company and reside in the data center.
once the hardware is availble, it still needs to pass by many teams before the application can be deployed.

- field engineers to install the phyiscal machines
- system administrators to set them up
- storage admins to allocate space on the server
- backup admins
- and in the end, the application team.

this whole process can take weeks, and it's hard to scale up and down when demand fluctuates. this all requires manual human labor, so there are many errors.

moving to cloud can reduce this problem, as the company doesn't need to own the hardware, and we use a virtual machine instead, this makes deployment much faster.
cloud providers also have APIs rather than human labor, which makes automation easier.

automating infrastructure provisioning was the basis for infrastructure as code.
