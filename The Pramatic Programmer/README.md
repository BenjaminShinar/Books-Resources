### The Cat Ate My Source Code

Take responsability. if you're in charge, be in charge.

### Software Entropy

Don't live with "broken windows" - fix issues when they are small, don't let problem persist, if you can't fix them, remove them, make sure that stuff are being handled and not neglected.

### Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

be a catalyst for a change. lead and others will follow. start small and let other help. avoid 'start-up fatigue' (won't a better name be 'start up anxiety'?).

### Good Enough Software

Be aware and be communicative about the trade-offs you're doing. different projects have different standards for what counts as 'quality' or 'good enough', not every piece of software runs pacemakers or spaceships. sometimes it's better to ship a program with some bugs today then delay it and release a 'perfect' (which means better, we'll never run out of bugs) version next year. and eventually, we have to stop working on a software, there is a point where fixes and additions are just harming us.

### Your Knowledge Portfolio

knowledge and experience are the best guides we have, but they decay, things change, best practices come and go, and changes in environment might mean that what was good last year is no longer recommended.

to keep our knowledge portfolio relevenat and valuable, we can treat in like our financial investments.

1. invsitage, regularly.
2. diversify.
3. balance between high risk - high reward investments and conservative ones.
4. buy low, sell high
5. periodically review and rebalanced the portfolio.

some goals that we can follow to make sure we are doing those things correctly. we should set goals and time limits, and more importantly, keep them.

- learning new languages
- reading technical books
- reading none-technical books - keep in touch with what none-programmers humans are up to
- take classes
- participate in local user group
- experiment with different environments
- stay current with professional magazine and knowledge sources
- get wired and seek out information that hasn't been put into the standardized knowledge bases yet (newsgroups, mailing lists)

seek out opportunities for learning. if you find something you don't know (even if it's not needed for work), try, seek out advice, build up the network.

think critically about what you read and hear, don't fall for the hype.

### Communicate

A good idea is nothing without communication. write memos, proposals, status reports, new ideas and approches.

know what you want to say. start with an outline, be sure that you cover all the points you want to get across.
know your audience. be aware of the other sides needs and intrests.
choose the settings, when and where to make suggestions.
have a style of presentation appropriate to the audience. don't forget about presentation, good looking documents are more likely to be read.
get your audience involved, listen to suggestions, incorporate input.
listen to others, encourage questions, promote dialog.
get back to people, keep the connection alive, respond, keep the other side informed.
